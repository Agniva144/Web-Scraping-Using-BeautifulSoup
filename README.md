# Web-Scraping-Using-BeautifulSoup

This Python script uses BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape shoe data from Amazon. It opens the site, waits for dynamic content to load, extracts shoe titles and prices, organizes the data into a Pandas DataFrame, and saves it to a CSV file named "data2.csv." The 'User-Agent' header is set to simulate a web browser.
